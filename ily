        <h1>Hey Babeeee,</h1> 
        <p> Mind I tell you how AMAZING you are like the best thing that’s ever happened to me? Or have I told you this may times before? Anyways, you deserve to be reminded. If I could, then every single moment. I never thought I’d be in love but then you came. And I fell for you. Really really hard. And I’m still falling. Flying. More and more. Every single day.  I mean everytime I say it. Thank you for everything. You're the reason I'm happy. You really were the missing piece in my life and now that I've found you , I'll never let you go . And I'm sorry if I get too clingy at times. But I love you . <3</p>

            <p>As promised, me taking you out for a date after YOU take me out, I’d love love LOVEEEEE to do that. I wish I could spend like every single day with you and I do hope and wait for the time when I can do that. I love spending time with you, it’s the happiest I am. No matter where or how or what, nothing matters as long as I have you. I’m like legitimately invincible sooooo....</p> 
            <p>Will you make me the happiest person in the world by agreeing to going out with me?</p>
